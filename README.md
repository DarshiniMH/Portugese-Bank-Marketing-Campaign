# Portuguese Bank Marketing Campaign

This project analyzes marketing campaign data from a Portuguese bank to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. The goal was to explore the data, engineer features, and build classification models to maximize marketing efficiency.

## Overview

- Dataset: [UCI Portuguese Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)
- Problem Type: Binary Classification (`yes`/`no`)
- Target: Customer subscription to term deposit
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
